###ENTRYPOINT
ENTRYPOINT is also used to run the container same like CMD.but there are few differences.
1.We cant override entrypoint, but we can override cmd
2.We cant override entrypoint, if you try to do so it will go and append to the entrypoint command.
3.If you use CMD and ENTRYPOINT and dont give any command from terminal, CMD acts as
argument provider to ENTRYPOINT.
